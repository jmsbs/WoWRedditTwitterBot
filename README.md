# WoWRedditTwitterBot
Bot that posts from r/WoW to Twitter account

The idea is:
- Bot uses Reddit API to get the posts according to the defined criteria
- Bot compares the postID to a list of already posted posts (eheh) and sees if the post is a duplicate. 
- Bot then posts to the twitter /rslashWoW account
